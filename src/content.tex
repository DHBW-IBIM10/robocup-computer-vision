\section{RoboCup \label{sec:robo}}
Robots play soccer.
Environment is dynamic.

Long Term Goal “By mid-21st century, a team of fully autonomous humanoid robot
soccer players shall win the soccer game, comply with the official rule of the
FIFA, against the winner of the most recent World
Cup.”\footcite[Cf.][]{robo_objectives}

Computational challenges are in the environment of the RoboCup.
Comparison to chess, where computers are superior already:

\subsection{RoboCup Leagues \label{sec:robo-leagues}}

%TODO: add short description for each league

\paragraph{Humanoid}
In the Humanoid League autonomous robots with human-like bodies play soccer
against each other.
Robots may only use sensors that cover human senses to perceive their
environment. Additional technical challenges in this league are proper running and ball
kicking while keeping the balance. Robots need to localize theirselves on the
field using the available sensors.
There are three categories within the humanoid league: KidSize (30-60cm height),
TeenSize (100-120cm) and AdultSize (130cm and taller).\footcite[Cf.][]{robo_humanoid_wiki}
 
\paragraph{Middle Size}
In the Middle Size League autonomous robots with zylindric bodies of no more
than 50cm diameter play soccer in teams of up to 6 players. Robots may use
wireless networking to communicate and all sensors are deployed on-board.\footcite[Cf.][]{robo_ms}
 
\paragraph{Simulation}
``In the 2D Simulation League, two teams of eleven autonomous software programs
(called agents) each play soccer in a two-dimensional virtual soccer stadium
represented by a central server, called SoccerServer.''\footcite[][]{robo_simu_wiki}
Agents receive relative and noisy input from their virtual sensors which they can use to
calculate and perform desired actions. There is also a 3D Simulation League which differs
from the 2D League by adding a third dimension and more complex physical
models.\footcite[Cf.][]{robo_simu_wiki}
 
\paragraph{Small Size}
In the Small Size League teams of five robots each compete on a field of 5.05~m~x~4.05~m.
Robots must fit in a circle with a diameter of 18cm and must not be higher than 15cm.
Robots are not fully autonomous as they can be controlled by off-field computers which receive
game information via a central software server which tracks locations and other parameters
of the game.\footcite[Cf.][]{robo_ssl_wiki}
This software is called SSL-Vision and will be covered in further detail in section
\ref{sec:ssl-vision}
 
\paragraph{Standard Platform} See \footcite[Cf.][]{robo_std_wiki}



\subsection{Related Research Areas \label{sec:robo-research}}
Computer vision is only one of many research areas that are relevant for the
RoboCup\footcite[Cf.][]{robo_objectives}
\begin{itemize}
  \item real-time sensor fusion
  \item reactive behavior
  \item strategy acquisition
  \item learning
  \item real-time planning
  \item multi-agent systems
  \item context recognition
  \item vision
  \item strategic decision-making
  \item motor control
  \item intelligent robot control
  \item and many more
\end{itemize}

\section{Computer Vision at RoboCup \label{sec:cv-robo}}

CV is used for all leagues, explain how.
SSL Vision is used for the small size league and wil be covered in separate
section.

\subsection{Centralized}
Robots and the ball are tracked via markings. A camera above the field sends
data to a computer which does real time analysis of image data to determine
positions and directions using COMPUTER VISION

``All objects on the field are tracked by a standardized vision system that
processes the data provided by two cameras that are attached to a camera bar
located 4m above the playing surface. The vision system - called SSL-Vision - is
an open source project maintained by the league's community."\footcite[Cf.][]{robo_ssl_wiki}

Robots and the ball are tracked via markings. A camera above the field sends
data to a computer which does real time analysis of image data to determine
positions and directions using COMPUTER VISION

  \label{fig:ssl_dataflow}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{savenotes}

\subsection{Distributed / Autonomous}
for other leagues. each robot has own cv.
In most other leagues robots have to rely on their own sensing, however they may
communicate with each other over the air.
Less computation power available, CV data needs to be translated to position,
etc. Robots need to keep track of other players and the ball + movements and
velocity of objects.

\section{SSL Vision \label{sec:ssl-vision}}
SSL Vision stuff.

\subsection{Application Overview \label{sec:ssl-overview}}



\begin{itemize}
  \item Written in C++, uses multithreading and comes with a GUI for
  configuration and controlling outputs
  \item Architecture: Multi-camera stack with one thread for each camera, for each camera plugins can be enabled
  \item Image processing framework with a modular structure, consisting of multiple plugins and common interfaces for data transfer
  \item Input: raw video streams from various cameras (IEEE 1394 / DCAM) or filestreams for development and testing
  \item Output: post processed image data in the GUI, robots identified by id and their positions
  \item \footcite[Cf.][]{zickler_ssl_vision}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Image Processing Stack}

\begin{itemize}
  \item each robot on the field is uniquely identifiable by a colored marker
  \item SSL-Vision needs to determine robots’ real-world locations (as opposed
        to location in the image), directions and IDs to get these data
        different algorithms/techniques need to be applied in real time
  \item color segmentation
  \item camera calibration
  \item pattern detection\footcite[Cf.][]{zickler_ssl_vision}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Color segmentation}
color segmentation is done with plugins for:\footcite[Cf.][]{zickler_ssl_vision}
\begin{itemize}
  \item color thresholding
  \item runlength-encoding 
  \item region extraction
  \item region sorting
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Color thresholding}
color thresholding is done via a lookup table which maps from the input image’s
3d color space (YUV) to a unique color label which represents any of the marker
colors, the ball color or other desired colors (source code) YUV: Color space,
e.g. used in PAL and NTSC videos, Y represents lumination and U/V color\footcite[Cf.][]{zickler_ssl_vision}

\paragraph{Runlength encoding}

\begin{itemize}
  \item the line by line runlength encoding is applied on the thresholded image to speed up the region extraction that follows (source code)
  \item simple data compression technique
  \item Algorithm for runlength encoding of images:
for each row of pixels:
remember pixel value and go to next pixel;
if pixel value equals previous pixel, merge pixels
  \item Example from Wikipedia:
“(...) screen containing plain black text on a solid white background. There will be many long runs of white pixels in the blank space, and many short runs of black pixels within the text. Let us take a hypothetical single scan line, with B representing a black pixel and W representing white:
WWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWBBBWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
If we apply the run-length encoding data compression algorithm to the above hypothetical scan line, we get the following:
12W1B12W3B24W1B14W”
  \item works well due to the previous color thresholding
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Region extraction}

pixels are only connected horizontally (lines)\\
vertical connections needed to get regions (polygons)\\
region extraction uses tree-based union find algorithm to traverse the
runlength-encoded image and merge neighboring runs of similar colors. (plugin
source code, region extraction source code)\\



Also see
\url{http://code.google.com/p/ssl-vision/source/browse/trunk/src/app/plugins/plugin_find_blobs.cpp}
and 
\url{http://code.google.com/p/ssl-vision/source/browse/trunk/src/shared/cmvision/cmvision_region.cpp#97}

Union find algorithm:\\
consists of find() and union()\footcite[Cf.][]{sedgewick_union_find}\\
good explanation at:
\footcite[Cf.][]{wa_union_find} \\

bounding boxes and centroids of all merged regions are then computed and finally
sorted by color and size\\

centroids will later be used for location determination
